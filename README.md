# Don't fall 

Don't Fall is a 3D game made by unity engine where you control a ball and must avoid falling off the platform. You will be attacked by waves of enemies, and you must try to survive. The game gets harder as you progress. There are also potions and powerups to make it easier for you to get rid of enemy balls.
